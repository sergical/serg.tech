I am going to keep this one short and sweet, partially because I do not have anyhting interesting to write about now, parly because I wanted to have at least one thing on my website.

If you really want, you can find some old writing on [Medium](https://medium.com/@416serg) and [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/416serg/). I’d migrate all of that over but I am lazy, maybe that’s a stretch goal for 2023.

Other 2023 goals:

- Get better at managing my finances
- Build a few side projects
- Read more
- Create some video content

I’ll try and keep updates here, but who knows, life is a funny thing and after the year we’ve had in 2022, anything can happen.

Stay tuned,
Love
Serge
